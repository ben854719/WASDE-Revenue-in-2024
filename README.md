Project: World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Revenue in 2024.

Summary:

The project will examine the revenue from the financial report of each country of the production of wheat from the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates in 2024. I will demonstrate with the use of Pytorch to extract the information from the dataset from the financial report (WASDE). I will use AI to analyze the information from the dataset. I will show you with the use of Pandas to clean and analyze the revenue from the dataset of the wheat production.  I will show you with the use of  Gemini to prompt your answers and your questions from the dataset of World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates in LLM.

Computer Skills: Pandas, Numpy,  Matplotlib, Langchain, LLM and Gemini.
