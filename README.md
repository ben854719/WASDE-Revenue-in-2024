## World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Revenue Analysis (2024)

## Project Overview:

This project aims to analyze global wheat production revenue using financial data from the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) for 2024. The study will examine export and import profits, leveraging AI-powered data analysis to extract key insights. PyTorch will be utilized to process and extract information from the WASDE dataset, while Pandas will clean and analyze revenue details within the financial report. Additionally, LangChain will be used to facilitate question-and-answer interactions, making financial data more accessible.

## Features:

- Revenue Analysis of Wheat Production: Extracts and evaluates financial data from WASDE reports.
- AI-Driven Data Processing: Uses PyTorch to analyze agricultural market trends efficiently.
- Advanced Data Cleaning: Pandas refines financial reports to ensure accuracy in revenue calculations.
- Visualization Tools: Matplotlib creates dynamic graphs illustrating global wheat production and financial impact.
- Automated Insights with LangChain: Generates interactive responses based on WASDE datasets, enhancing user understanding.
- LLM & Gemini Integration: Employs advanced AI models to forecast revenue trends and support economic predictions.

## Usage Instructions:

- Set Up Dependencies: Install Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, LangChain, and Matplotlib using the package manager.
- Load WASDE Dataset: Import financial data from NASDAQ or USDAâ€™s WASDE report.
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Utilize Pandas to refine and structure the dataset.
- Financial Analysis with AI: Apply PyTorch and LLM models to evaluate revenue trends.
- Visualization of Economic Insights: Generate visual representations of wheat production, exports, and imports.
- Interactive Q&A Using LangChain: Users can prompt economic questions and receive AI-generated insights.
