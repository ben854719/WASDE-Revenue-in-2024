            "The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) is prepared and released by the World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB). The report is released monthly, and provides annual forecasts for supply and use of U.S. and world wheat, rice, coarse grains, oilseeds, and cotton. The report also covers U.S. supply and use of sugar, meat, poultry eggs and milk, as well as Mexico’s supply and use of sugar. The WAOB chairs the Interagency Commodity Estimates Committees (ICECs), which include analysts from key USDA agencies who compile and interpret information from USDA and other domestic and foreign sources to produce the report. For more information about the WASDE process and data, visit the WASDE FAQs page.2025 WASDE Release Dates (12:00pm ET)Jan. 10, Feb. 11, Mar. 11, Apr. 10, May 12, Jun. 12, Jul. 11, Aug. 12, Sep. 12, Oct. 9, Nov. 10, and Dec. 9January 2025 WASDE Report (Release time: 12:00 PM ET, January 10)PDF     XML      Excel      TextErrata Notes: The December 10, 2024, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) Report was reposted to correct an inaccuracy in the sugar section. U.S. sugar beginning stocks for 2024/25 were revised downward after new information about beet sugar production became available following the initial report release. This resulted in an increase to projected imports from Mexico.December 2024 WASDE ReportPDF     XML      Excel      TextRelated ContentWASDE Visualization (This visualization is updated each month at 3:00 pm, the day after the WASDE release)Consolidated Historical WASDE Report Data 2010-2025 (WASDE Report data in .CSV format updated each month, the day after the WASDE release)Upland and Extra Long Staple Cotton EstimatesWASDE Archive (1973 - Present)Weekly Weather and Crop BulletinSign up for WASDE–related notifications and other news from WAOB (select the ‘Ag Economics’ mail list).\n",
